This program is written by Ray Wulf.

Building:

```make```

The above will create a ChDir binary *(executable)* to run.

You can use it directly with `./` or create a Symlink to it in /usr/bin.

Usage:

```ChDir </path/to/directory>```

After that you can just us the alias created *(pwd does NOT matter)*:

```ChDir directory```

I know, I'll add more to the README when I can.
